# Location Based AR app
 The location-based AR app developed using AR.js
 
The location-based AR app developed using AR.js creates a unique virtual art gallery experience for users. By leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology, the app merges the real world with digital art, allowing users to explore and interact with virtual artworks in specific physical locations.

When users launch the app and grant location permissions, it uses their device's GPS or other positioning methods to determine their precise location. Based on this information, the app identifies nearby designated areas or landmarks where the virtual art gallery is set up.
